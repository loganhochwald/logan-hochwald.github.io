# Recursion Prompts
- This is a repository of prompts to be solved using recursion inside of `src/recursion.js`
- Please refrain from sharing solutions
- Try to solve prompts first using pseudocode
- This repo requires that the overall function itself is called recursively and pays no attention to subroutines called recursively.
- Feel free to make pull requests regarding bugs or suggestions
- Fork it.  You know you want to.

- To find the work place, go to src and you'll find the recursion.js file
- To check work go to Spec Runner.html
- Every function highlighted in blue (in the spec runner file) are not required to be done for this project

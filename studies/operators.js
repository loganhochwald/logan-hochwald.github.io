/**
 * OPERATORS:
 * 0. 
 * 1. Assignment operators assign values to variables, where the left side has the variable, then the operators, then everything 
 * on the right is the value in which the variable is being assigned. There is a simple type, which requires the variable and value
 * to be the same type with a = in between them, and compound, which has arithmetic symbols such as += attached to it. These perform
 * the arithmetic function and then apply that new value to the variable.
 * 2. Arithmetic operators perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). The modulus operator (%)
 * returns the remainder of the division of two numbers.
 * 3. Comparison operators compare numbers and strings then return a boolean value. The == compares equal to value, the === compares
 * strictly equal to (value and type), !== and != are opposite of those, and the arithmetic comparisons of greater/less than (> and
 * <), as well as greater/less than or equal to (>=, <=).
 * 4. Logical operators are used in logic statements comparing values and variables. And (&&), or (||), and not (!) are the three 
 * that are used. For and and or, the first expression is before the operator, and the second expression is after. And includes the
 * two expressions and both must be true for the condition to resolve to true, while or only needs one condition to be true to resolve
 * to true. Not is used in front of an expression and resolves to true if the expression normally resolves to false. This is useful
 * in conditional statements for loops, for example.
 * 5. Unary operators require only one operand to perform the operation. This includes the arithmethic operators, not logical operator, 
 * as well as increment/decrement. 
 * 6. Ternary operators are one lines of code that are to replace else-if or switch statements; they are used to save time and space
 * within the program. The ? operator is used in between the conditional statement and the true execution : false execution as shown.
 * The syntax is: variable = Expression 1 (conditional statement) ? Expression 2 (executed if true) : Expression 3 (executed if false)
